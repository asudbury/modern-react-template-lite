# AI Agents Guide

This repository is agent-friendly.

For all detailed conventions and rules that AI agents must follow (accessibility, TypeScript strictness, design tokens, testing, CI expectations, and file structure), see:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

That file is the single source of truth for agent behavior in this project. `AGENTS.md` exists only to point agents and contributors there and avoid duplicated, drifting documentation.
